                         I recently worked as a Research Programmer Intern at Boston Fusion, where I helped enhance operational analysis tools and conducted research to improve classification and visual understanding. I have also gained hands-on experience in IT support and customer service through roles at Essex North Shore School and Old Navy. At UMass, I serve as the Public Relations Chair for the Vietnamese Students Association, where I design graphics, manage social media outreach, and organize cultural events.
